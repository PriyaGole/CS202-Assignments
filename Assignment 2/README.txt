// SAT_Solver

To run the code: 
1. Open terminal. Make sure you are currently in the code directory. 
2. Run "g++ solver.cpp -o solver && ./solver"
3. Input the test file path without quotations. (Eg. "tests/test1.cnf" without the quotations. 
    //Test files can be found in "Tests" folder 


INPUT FORMAT: 
For test1: 
    tests/test1.cnf

For test2:
    tests/test2.cnf

For test3:
    tests/test3.cnf

For test4:
    tests/test4.cnf

For test5:
    tests/test5.cnf


OUTPUT: 
For test1: SATisfiable

For test2: unSATisfiable 

For test3: SATisfiable

For test4: SATisfiable 

For test5: unSATisfiable

P.S: Last two test cases have been imported from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html for better validation of solver.
